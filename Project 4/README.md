# Project 4 - Central Limit Theorem

This project focuses on the simulation of continuous random variables with different experiments.

Refer to the PDF report for full documentation of the project

## 1. Simulate Continuous Random Variables with Selected Distributions

In this section, a continuous random variable is simulated with different means of distributions. These types of distributions are uniform, exponential, and normal.

We are to calculate the theoretical calculation and the experimental measurement of the expectation and the standard deviation.

## 2. The Central Limit Theorem

This section explores the central limit theorem. In this simulation, we have a collection of books, each with a thickness 𝑊. The thickness 𝑊 is a RV uniformly distributed between a minimum of a and a maximum of b cm. Using these values, we are to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the thickness.

In addition, we are to calculate books piled in stacks of 𝑛 = 1, 5, or 15 books. The width 𝑆𝑛 of staa ck of n books is the RV, and this RV has a mean of 𝜇𝑠𝑛=𝑛𝜇𝑤 and a standard deviation of 𝜎𝑠𝑛= 𝜎𝑤√𝑛

The first simulation runs for 𝑁=10,000 experiments, simulating the RV 𝑆=𝑊1 and creating a histogram that includes the function normal distribution probability function

## 3. Distribution of the Sum of Exponential RVs

In this section, we are to calculate the probability that a carton of 24 batteries will last within certain timeframes. The lifetime of a single battery lasts for 𝛽=40 days. The first experiment is finding the probability that the carton will last longer than 3 years using the PDF graph, and the second experiment is finding the probability that the carton will last between 2.0 and 2.5 years using the CDF graph.

# Project 5 - Condence Intervals

## 1. Effect of Sample Size on Confidence Interval

In this project, we are exploring the relation of X to the population mean . The scenario is taking a small sample of bearings (size n) and calculating the sample mean X and the sample standard deviation ^ S. We are creating two graphs with sample means: one with 95 percent condence intervals and another with 99 percent condence intervals.

## 2. Using the Sample Mean to Estimate the Population Mean

In this section, we are using dierent sizes of n to check the probability of success that the
mean  falls in between the lower and upper bounds of each condence intervals. It should be noted that depending on the size of n, we would have to either use a Normal distribution or large samples (n  30) or a Student's t distribution for small samples (n < 30).
